## Additional Content

This pack includes a heavily modified Buymenu made specifically for it.  
Here are the following commands that can be used in the Buymenu:

```
// Opening the Buy menu in the chat:
buy
/buy
!buy
.buy
\buy
#buy

// Opening the Buy menu in the console:
.buy

// Buying a specific weapon/ammo (without the weapon_ prefix) without the menu:
<menu opening command here> <entity identifier here> <weapon name here> ie:
!buy w p90 (will directly buy a P90 for you) or 
/buy a p90 (will directly buy ammo for the P90 for you)

// Buying ammo for the current equipped weapon:
<menu opening command here> ammo ie:
!buy ammo or
/buy ammo
```

Server commands (in case you registered the weapons as a plugin):
```
as_command cs16.bm_maxmoney <value>
as_command cs16.bm_moneyperscore <value>
as_command cs16.bm_startmoney <value>
```

## Notes

This pack includes a *.fgd* file and a *.res* file (this one which shouldn't be needed).  
There are several notable differences here compared to the old project:  
* **Organization**: The project is more organized than ever before. This helps reduce the amount of clutter and resources sent to the player.  
* **Original Rifle Muzzleflashes**: With the knowledge obtained with past projects, we're able to bring you the original X shaped Muzzleflash for rifles back, without conflicting with the original game.  
* **Original HE Grenade Entity**: The HE Grenade projectile thrown by the player should behave closely to the original 1.6 projectile.  
* **Customization without modification of original scripts**: Similarly to the Insurgency Project, you're now able to modify most of the entity data, without modifying the original script, in your own map script.  
* **Original C4 Entity**: Thanks to Nero for making the original projectile, the code has been cleaned up a little bit and it allows for more customization.  
* **Original Scope for Sniper Rifles**: Thanks for D.N.I.O. 071 for making a custom scope viewmodel that fits very well with the original sprites used in 1.6.  
* **Fixed Player Models**: The original 1.6 player models were fixed to fit the Sven's Playermodel skeleton, no more aiming down.  
* **Buy Menu Similar to 1.6**: The menu has been redesigned to closely resemble the original Buy Menu, with the $ added as well, similarly to the Insurgency Project.  
* **Magazine Entities for Every Weapon**: Thanks for D.N.I.O. 071 for compiling the model which includes all magazines for all weapons.  
Shoutout for Solokiller for helping me initially in 2016 with this project.
